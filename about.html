            <h3 class="TITLE">Pastor Gillard Biography</h3>

            <p>
              Born in Cherryville, NC, to parents Fred and Jacquline Gilliard,
              he attended public school in Williamsburg County and graduated in
              1980. On December 29, 1985, he was united in Holy Matrimony to the
              First Lady Geradline Gilliard. They are blessed with two sons:
              Anthony Antiwan Gilliard, Jr., and Anthony Anterrius Gilliard.
            </p>

            <h2 class="SUBTITLE">The Vision Begins</h2>

            <p>
              "Back in 1991, I was living in New York City when God reached out
              to me, and I began to seek the Lord with my life. Soon after, the
              Lord spoke to me through a vision. I had just come from church and
              was trying to get some sleep when suddenly it seemed as though the
              Lord took me up into the sky. I could see the city far below me,
              and I could see snow falling around me in the vision. Then the
              scene below me in the vision changed instantly, and in my spirit,
              I felt as though I was in South Carolina. I could see all the
              trees below me, and God brought me back down to the earth in this
              vision, and I recognized the location where I landed.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was my childhood home. In the vision, it was as though I was
              being led by someone, but I never could see them. I was led to a
              field, which I remembered from when I was young, and I was led
              across it. Though when I first saw it, I wondered how I could ever
              cross because the field appeared to be freshly plowed. As I
              wondered, a light appeared near me in the field, and it was as
              though a road appeared before me from one side of the field to the
              other side. The road was a glass road with pits of fire under the
              glass all the way across. Then I went down in the ditch, which I
              also remembered from when I was young. Once I crossed on the other
              side of the ditch and made it out to the home of my aunt, my
              grandmother's home was right next to it. I saw a pretty apple tree
              in the backyard. As I was walking toward the sight, something
              caught my attention, and I looked back and saw in the front yard a
              man sitting in a chair. He had his head down - I couldn't see his
              face because it was twilight dark. I went toward the sight asking
              who it was. As I got closer, everything vanished. Then the vision
              ended, and I awoke back home in New York City.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first thought that struck me was that God had spoken to me to
              return to my childhood home in South Carolina and he would show me
              what it was that he had for me to do. Yet I didn't fully
              understand how I was to go about it at the time. In New York, I
              had a very good job for which I was thankful, and I needed a way
              to provide for my family, not to mention I had gone through some
              difficult experiences back in South Carolina. I wrestled with God
              over this decision for a number of months. Then one Sunday
              morning, my Pastor, Bishop Bonner, preached a powerful sermon, and
              it seemed to me as though he was speaking directly to me. In the
              message, he said that if you have a difficult decision to make in
              your service to the Lord, go on a ten-day fast and trust the Lord
              to give you the answer.
            </p>

            <p>
              I took that for the gospel because I certainly had some decisions
              to make. So, I began fasting and praying, but as the tenth day
              drew near, I almost felt as though God wouldn't speak to me. Yet
              on the morning of the tenth day, I got my answer. The strange
              thing that I experienced that morning was that I could hear the
              sounds of birds chirping loud and clear, which you never hear in
              New York. I heard that sound in the subway train and in the
              hallways of the office building in which I worked, and in the
              elevator of the office building in which I worked.
            </p>

            <p>
              As soon as I exited the elevator, I was standing right next to my
              boss's desk, and he was sitting right there. Without a second
              thought, I spoke up and told him that I was giving him two weeks'
              notice and I would be leaving the company. He asked if I had a job
              lined up or if I needed a recommendation, "NO SIR," I answered
              him. He didn't understand it all, and honestly, I didn't either,
              but I knew I just needed to trust the Lord.
            </p>

            <p>
              Those next two weeks were hectic, finishing up my work by day and
              getting ready to head back home to South Carolina by night. I
              didn't even have the chance to explain matters to my Pastor,
              Church Family, or friends, but as the day to leave arrived, God
              spoke to me and said, 'Just Trust Me.' Many things could have gone
              wrong on the way back, and some came dangerously close. The Lord
              was with us, and he brought us safely home.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was being led strongly by the Holy Spirit at this time, and I
              know for sure that the work the Lord had for me was to start a
              church right here in my own home community. At first, this
              ministry was a door-to-door witnessing ministry. My heart was
              always made glad at how kind so many people were to invite me into
              their homes and come to our services. The Lord always provided for
              my family and me. There were some very hard times as well that
              followed. We all have a cross to bear. We need to remember that
              there is no easy way to God.
            </p>

            <p>
              I later met some people who claimed to be friends to me and the
              people here at the church. However, I slowly but surely came to
              find out that their main purpose was to take advantage of us. I
              later found out that they would have gone so far as to destroy our
              church and our ministry, and they certainly tried everything in
              their power to do so, but praise be to God, who in his sovereign
              plan and power, delivered our church from the evil imaginations of
              those who would have destroyed us, and in a miracle of God, we
              were completely freed from those people as well and since being
              given back our freedom, our church could once again begin to
              flourish. As painful of an experience as this was, especially at
              the time, I came to understand through it all that what the enemy
              meant for evil, God meant for good. In a number of ways, God used
              these hardships to teach me and make me a better minister to the
              people here.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was a boy, I never really knew my father, and that was
              always hard for me. When some people who were older than me and
              had so much more experience in the business of the church promised
              to be there for me and the church and help us, I trusted them and
              even looked at them as my own father. I put my trust in them, and
              whatever they told me to do, I tried my best to do it. It was as
              though I had started to put my trust in them. The Bible tells us
              that "it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in
              man" (Psalms 118:8). That verse is in the middle of the Bible, and
              I am sure that it's there for a reason. I learned the hard way
              that if there is someone you can put your trust in, who will never
              fail you, then "trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not
              on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge him, and
              he will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5-6).
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm sure that God taught me through all of this to make me a
              better shepherd to his people and to show me to discern and be on
              guard against the wrong influence. The Lord has given us so many
              blessings. We now have a beautiful Church Family which has gotten
              larger with the birth of my sons, and I have met some truly
              faithful men of God who have a heart's desire for the work of
              Christ. One man, in particular, has been so kind to me. I still
              remember what he told me in trying to bless me by telling me what
              he has learned in his long ministry. His words to me were,
              "Remember the vision God gave you and write it all down because
              the vision is for an appointed time." And now, the vision has come
              clearly to me in 1993 when the Lord has given me the name for the
              church: COMMUNITY TEMPLE CHURCH

          We believe that Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh, fulfilling
          the role of both the Father and the Son. This understanding is drawn
          from scriptures such as 1 Timothy 3:16 (KJV), which reveals the
          mystery of godliness, and Colossians 2:9 (KJV), which confirms that
          all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Jesus Christ.

          We believe in the necessity of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for
          the remission of sins and receiving the Holy Spirit, as demonstrated

          In addition to salvation, we are called to live a life of holiness,
          set apart for God. Scripture commands that we pursue holiness in all
          areas of life, because without holiness, no one will see the Lord.
          Living holy means striving to reflect God's righteousness and obey His
          commandments. This is rooted in scriptures such as Luke 1:75 and
          Hebrews 12:14 (KJV), which emphasize living in holiness and
          righteousness all our days.

          We also hold to the belief that God is one, and this oneness is
          revealed in Jesus Christ. He is both the Father and the Son, as stated
          in John 10:30 (KJV) and Isaiah 9:6 (KJV), showing that Jesus is the
          everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace. This doctrine of the
          oneness of God is central to our faith.

          Furthermore, we believe that speaking in tongues is the initial
          evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit, as seen in Acts 2:4, Acts
          10:44-46, and Acts 19:6. Speaking in tongues is a sign that

      <h1 class="forum-title">Common Questions</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <!-- Second question -->
        <div class="question">Why should you baptize in Jesus' name?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Baptism in Jesus' name is vital because it follows the example set by
          the apostles in the New Testament. Acts 2:38 shows that baptism in
          Jesus' name is directly linked to the remission of sins and the
          promise of receiving the Holy Spirit. Baptizing in the name of Jesus
          signifies the believer’s identification with Christ's death, burial,
          and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4). It's the biblical method of baptism
          for salvation.
        </div>

        <!-- Third question -->
        <div class="question">
          Is speaking in tongues required to show you have received the Holy
          Spirit?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of receiving the Holy
          Spirit, according to the scriptures. In Acts 2:4, 10:44-46, and 19:6,
          believers spoke in tongues when they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
          While other manifestations of the Spirit may follow, speaking in
          tongues serves as the outward sign of the infilling of the Holy Ghost
          in the New Testament church.
        </div>

        <!-- Fourth question -->
        <div class="question">Is Jesus both the Father and the Son?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, we believe that Jesus is both the Father and the Son, as revealed
          in scriptures like John 10:30 and Isaiah 9:6. Jesus is the
          manifestation of the one true God in the flesh. Colossians 2:9 tells
          us that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Jesus bodily, meaning
          that in Him exists the full presence of the Father and the Son,
          fulfilling both divine roles in one person.
        </div>

        <!-- Fifth question -->
        <div class="question">Why is living a holy life important?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Living a holy life is essential because scripture commands it (Hebrews
          12:14). Holiness means being set apart for God and striving to reflect
          His righteousness in every area of life. Luke 1:75 encourages us to
          live in holiness and righteousness all our days. Without holiness, no
          one will see the Lord, which underscores the importance of living
          according to God’s commands and pursuing a life that reflects His
          character.
        </div>

        <!-- Eighth question -->
        <div class="question">Can Christians listen to secular music?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Whether Christians should listen to secular music is a matter of
          personal conviction and discernment. Philippians 4:8 encourages
          believers to focus on things that are true, honorable, and pure. Music
          has a powerful influence on our minds and spirits, and believers are
          called to avoid anything that might pull them away from God’s
          presence. While not all secular music is inherently bad, Christians
          should evaluate the message, content, and impact it has on their
          spiritual life. If the music promotes values contrary to holiness, it
          is best avoided.
        </div>

        <!-- Tenth question -->
        <div class="question">Is dancing sinful?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Dancing in itself is not sinful. There are examples in the Bible of
          people dancing in worship and celebration before the Lord, like King
          David in 2 Samuel 6:14. However, the context of dancing matters
          greatly. If the dancing promotes immorality, lust, or behaviors that
          do not align with a holy life, then it is inappropriate for believers.
          Christians should ensure that their actions, including dancing, honor
          God and reflect purity and righteousness.
