            <p class="intro">
              Born in Cherryville, NC, to parents Fred and Jacquline Gilliard,
              Pastor Gillard attended public school in Williamsburg County and
              graduated in 1980. On December 29, 1985, he was united in Holy
              Matrimony to the First Lady, Geradline Gilliard. They are blessed
              with two sons: Anthony Antiwan Gilliard, Jr., and Anthony
              Anterrius Gilliard.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Vision Begins</h2>

            <blockquote class="vision-quote">
              "Back in 1991, I was living in New York City when God reached out
              to me, and I began to seek the Lord with my life. Soon after, the
              Lord spoke to me through a vision..."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="vision-body">
              In this vision, Pastor Gillard saw himself being lifted into the
              sky, seeing the city far below him, and then transported to South
              Carolina. He saw snow falling around him and, in a moment, was
              back at his childhood home. There, he was led across a field,
              observing a glass road with pits of fire beneath it. Pastor
              Gillard recalls, "As I crossed the ditch and headed toward my
              grandmother's home, I saw a man sitting in a chair. His head was
              down, and as I approached, everything vanished, and I woke up in
              New York City."
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Call to Return</h2>

            <blockquote class="quote-call-to-action">
              "God had spoken to me: return to my childhood home in South
              Carolina, and He would show me what He had for me to do."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Struggling to understand how to fulfill this calling, Pastor
              Gillard wrestled with the decision for months. While living in New
              York, he had a good job, but the call from God was undeniable. One
              Sunday morning, his Pastor, Bishop Bonner, preached a sermon that
              seemed meant for him: "If you have a difficult decision to make,
              go on a ten-day fast and trust the Lord."
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Trusting the Lord</h2>

            <p>
              Pastor Gillard embarked on a ten-day fast, praying for God's
              guidance. By the tenth day, he hadn't yet received an answer, but
              on that morning, something miraculous happened: "I heard birds
              chirping in the subway and the office hallways—something that you
              never hear in New York."
            </p>

            <p>
              At that moment, without hesitation, he gave his boss two weeks'
              notice. When asked about his future plans, he simply responded: "I
              just need to trust the Lord."
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Journey Back Home</h2>

            <blockquote class="quote-journey">
              "Just trust Me," the Lord said. And so, Pastor Gillard and his
              family set out for South Carolina. Despite obstacles, they made
              the journey safely.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Upon his return, Pastor Gillard was strongly led by the Holy
              Spirit to start a ministry in his hometown. The initial focus was
              on door-to-door witnessing, with many opening their homes and
              hearts to the ministry. "The Lord always provided for us, even
              during the hardest times," he recalls.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Overcoming Adversity</h2>

            <p>
              As the church grew, Pastor Gillard encountered challenges. Certain
              individuals sought to take advantage of the ministry, but God’s
              sovereign power delivered the church from their evil plans. "What
              the enemy meant for evil, God turned into good," Pastor Gillard
              reflects.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Lessons in Faith</h2>

            <blockquote class="quote-scripture">
              "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man."
              (Psalms 118:8)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Pastor Gillard learned that only the Lord is worthy of his
              complete trust. "God used these hardships to make me a better
              shepherd to His people," he says, grateful for the blessings that
              followed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">A Growing Church Family</h2>

            <p>
              Today, the church family has expanded, and Pastor Gillard
              continues to be inspired by faithful men of God. One mentor told
              him:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="quote-mentor">
              "Remember the vision God gave you and write it down, for the
              vision is for an appointed time."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              In 1993, the Lord gave Pastor Gillard the name for the church:
              <strong>Community Temple Church.</strong>
            </p>

        <p class="beliefs-paragraph">
          At Community Temple Church, we follow the biblical plan of salvation
          as taught in the Book of Acts. We believe in baptism in the name of
          Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and the receiving of the Holy
          Spirit, evidenced by speaking in tongues.
        </p>

        <p class="beliefs-paragraph">
          We also affirm that Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh, fully
          embodying both the Father and the Son. This truth is revealed in
          scriptures such as 1 Timothy 3:16 and Colossians 2:9, where the
          mystery of godliness and the fullness of the Godhead are explained in
          relation to Christ.
        </p>

        <h2 class="scripture-title">1 Timothy 3:16 (KJV):</h2>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was
          manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
          preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
          glory.”
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="scripture-title">Colossians 2:9 (KJV):</h2>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          “For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”
        </blockquote>

        <p class="beliefs-paragraph">
          Baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is essential for the remission of
          sins, and we find clear instruction in <em>Acts 2:38</em>, where Peter
          outlines the steps to salvation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="scripture-title">Acts 2:38 (KJV):</h2>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you
          in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall
          receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”
        </blockquote>

        <p class="beliefs-paragraph">
          We are also called to live a life of holiness, set apart for God. The
          scriptures command us to pursue holiness, as without it, no one will
          see the Lord. Holiness involves reflecting God's righteousness in
          every area of life. This calling is supported by scriptures like Luke
          1:75 and Hebrews 12:14, which emphasize living in righteousness and
          holiness throughout our lives.
        </p>

        <h2 class="scripture-title">Luke 1:75 (KJV):</h2>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          “In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.”

          “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall
          see the Lord.”
        </blockquote>

        <p class="beliefs-paragraph">
          Central to our faith is the belief in the oneness of God, revealed in
          Jesus Christ. He is both the Father and the Son, as stated in John
          10:30 and Isaiah 9:6, showing that Jesus is the everlasting Father and
          the Prince of Peace.

          Prince of Peace.”

        <p class="beliefs-paragraph">
          We believe that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of
          receiving the Holy Spirit, as seen in multiple accounts in Acts. This
          spiritual sign accompanies the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the
          life of a believer.

          We also uphold biblical teachings regarding church roles and ministry.
          We do not endorse women preaching in church services, following
          scriptures such as 1 Timothy 2:11-12 and 1 Corinthians 11:3, which
          outline the roles of men and women in the church.

          “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not
          a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in
          silence.”

          Furthermore, we believe that a divorced man cannot pastor a church,
          based on 1 Timothy 3:2. This verse emphasizes that a bishop must be
          the husband of one wife, guiding us to the conclusion that a divorced
          man should not serve in the role of pastor.
