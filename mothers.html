          To Our Mother Our lives seem so strange without you here, There was
          never a time when you weren't near. But as we look around us, you'll
          never be gone, For you left us with memories that will always live on.
          To some you may be forgotten, to others a part of the past, But to
          those who loved and lost you, your memory will last. There is a chair
          at the table that can never be filled, Since God took you home and
          your voice has been stilled We see you in many places along life's
          way, Sometimes we can hear you in something we say, We know in our
          hearts that God knew what was best, When He silenced your pain and
          took you home to rest. ~ Love, Your Children

          Little Did We Know Mom, little did we know that morning that God would
          call your name. In life we loved you dearly, in death we do the same.
          It broke our hearts to lose you, but you did not go alone. For part of
          us went with you the day God called you home. You left us peaceful
          memories, your love is still our guide. And though we cannot see you,
          you are always on our side. Our family chain is broken and nothing
          seems the same. But as God calls us one by one, the chain will link
          again.

          nothing in return. As we look upon her picture, sweet memories we
          recall Of a face so full of sunshine, and a smile for one and all.
          Sweet Jesus take this message to our dear mother up above; Tell her

          To Our Mother These are words that you will never hear. These are
          words whispered low and clear. You told us you were tired, but yet
          still strong. You told us don't worry, for worrying is wrong. Coming
          home was one thing you mentioned, And we waited for that day. But the
          coming home we looked for, We didn't know it was this way. We wish you
          were here and going to miss you so dear, But God loves you better, And

          Until we became much older, Mom, There was just no way we could know,
          The sacrifices you must have made, As you watched your children grow.
          We didn't consider how tired you were, At the end of every long day,
          Or appreciate the meals you cooked... We were clueless, we guess you
          could say. We never thought of the time you spent, Tending to all of
          our needs, Putting us first each step of the way... And that's how
          your life story reads. Now, without question, we understand, A phase
          that still rings in my ear, "There's a special place in heaven for
          Moms?" Looking back makes it all the more clear!
