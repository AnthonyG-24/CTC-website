              he attended public school in Williamsburg County and graduated in

            <h2 class="SUBTITLE">The Vision Begins</h2>

            <p>
              "Back in 1991, I was living in New York City when God reached out
              to me, and I began to seek the Lord with my life. Soon after, the
              Lord spoke to me through a vision. I had just come from church and
              was trying to get some sleep when suddenly it seemed as though the
              Lord took me up into the sky. I could see the city far below me,
              and I could see snow falling around me in the vision. Then the
              scene below me in the vision changed instantly, and in my spirit,
              I felt as though I was in South Carolina. I could see all the
              trees below me, and God brought me back down to the earth in this
              vision, and I recognized the location where I landed.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was my childhood home. In the vision, it was as though I was
              being led by someone, but I never could see them. I was led to a
              field, which I remembered from when I was young, and I was led
              across it. Though when I first saw it, I wondered how I could ever
              cross because the field appeared to be freshly plowed. As I
              wondered, a light appeared near me in the field, and it was as
              though a road appeared before me from one side of the field to the
              other side. The road was a glass road with pits of fire under the
              glass all the way across. Then I went down in the ditch, which I
              also remembered from when I was young. Once I crossed on the other
              side of the ditch and made it out to the home of my aunt, my
              grandmother's home was right next to it. I saw a pretty apple tree
              in the backyard. As I was walking toward the sight, something
              caught my attention, and I looked back and saw in the front yard a
              man sitting in a chair. He had his head down - I couldn't see his
              face because it was twilight dark. I went toward the sight asking
              who it was. As I got closer, everything vanished. Then the vision
              ended, and I awoke back home in New York City.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first thought that struck me was that God had spoken to me to
              return to my childhood home in South Carolina and he would show me
              what it was that he had for me to do. Yet I didn't fully
              understand how I was to go about it at the time. In New York, I
              had a very good job for which I was thankful, and I needed a way
              to provide for my family, not to mention I had gone through some
              difficult experiences back in South Carolina. I wrestled with God
              over this decision for a number of months. Then one Sunday
              morning, my Pastor, Bishop Bonner, preached a powerful sermon, and
              it seemed to me as though he was speaking directly to me. In the
              message, he said that if you have a difficult decision to make in
              your service to the Lord, go on a ten-day fast and trust the Lord
              to give you the answer.
            </p>

            <p>
              I took that for the gospel because I certainly had some decisions
              to make. So, I began fasting and praying, but as the tenth day
              drew near, I almost felt as though God wouldn't speak to me. Yet
              on the morning of the tenth day, I got my answer. The strange
              thing that I experienced that morning was that I could hear the
              sounds of birds chirping loud and clear, which you never hear in
              New York. I heard that sound in the subway train and in the
              hallways of the office building in which I worked, and in the
              elevator of the office building in which I worked.
            </p>

            <p>
              As soon as I exited the elevator, I was standing right next to my
              boss's desk, and he was sitting right there. Without a second
              thought, I spoke up and told him that I was giving him two weeks'
              notice and I would be leaving the company. He asked if I had a job
              lined up or if I needed a recommendation, "NO SIR," I answered
              him. He didn't understand it all, and honestly, I didn't either,
              but I knew I just needed to trust the Lord.
            </p>

            <p>
              Those next two weeks were hectic, finishing up my work by day and
              getting ready to head back home to South Carolina by night. I
              didn't even have the chance to explain matters to my Pastor,
              Church Family, or friends, but as the day to leave arrived, God
              spoke to me and said, 'Just Trust Me.' Many things could have gone
              wrong on the way back, and some came dangerously close. The Lord
              was with us, and he brought us safely home.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was being led strongly by the Holy Spirit at this time, and I
              know for sure that the work the Lord had for me was to start a
              church right here in my own home community. At first, this
              ministry was a door-to-door witnessing ministry. My heart was
              always made glad at how kind so many people were to invite me into
              their homes and come to our services. The Lord always provided for
              my family and me. There were some very hard times as well that
              followed. We all have a cross to bear. We need to remember that
              there is no easy way to God.
            </p>

            <p>
              I later met some people who claimed to be friends to me and the
              people here at the church. However, I slowly but surely came to
              find out that their main purpose was to take advantage of us. I
              later found out that they would have gone so far as to destroy our
              church and our ministry, and they certainly tried everything in
              their power to do so, but praise be to God, who in his sovereign
              plan and power, delivered our church from the evil imaginations of
              those who would have destroyed us, and in a miracle of God, we
              were completely freed from those people as well and since being
              given back our freedom, our church could once again begin to
              flourish. As painful of an experience as this was, especially at
              the time, I came to understand through it all that what the enemy
              meant for evil, God meant for good. In a number of ways, God used
              these hardships to teach me and make me a better minister to the
              people here.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was a boy, I never really knew my father, and that was
              always hard for me. When some people who were older than me and
              had so much more experience in the business of the church promised
              to be there for me and the church and help us, I trusted them and
              even looked at them as my own father. I put my trust in them, and
              whatever they told me to do, I tried my best to do it. It was as
              though I had started to put my trust in them. The Bible tells us
              that "it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in
              man" (Psalms 118:8). That verse is in the middle of the Bible, and
              I am sure that it's there for a reason. I learned the hard way
              that if there is someone you can put your trust in, who will never
              fail you, then "trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not
              on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge him, and
              he will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5-6).
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm sure that God taught me through all of this to make me a
              better shepherd to his people and to show me to discern and be on
              guard against the wrong influence. The Lord has given us so many
              blessings. We now have a beautiful Church Family which has gotten
              larger with the birth of my sons, and I have met some truly
              faithful men of God who have a heart's desire for the work of
              Christ. One man, in particular, has been so kind to me. I still
              remember what he told me in trying to bless me by telling me what
              he has learned in his long ministry. His words to me were,
              "Remember the vision God gave you and write it all down because
              the vision is for an appointed time." And now, the vision has come
              clearly to me in 1993 when the Lord has given me the name for the
              church: COMMUNITY TEMPLE CHURCH
